## Payment Workflow

### Admin Workflow
1. **Calculate Payment**
   - Select freelancer and date range
   - System fetches performance records
   - Applies project-based rates (hourly/per-asset/per-object)
   - Generates line items
   - Preview total before creating

2. **Create Payment**
   - Manual creation or from calculation
   - Payment status: PENDING

3. **Approve Payment**
   - Review payment details
   - Click "Approve" → Status: APPROVED
   - Records approver and timestamp

4. **Mark as Paid**
   - Enter payment method (BANK_TRANSFER, MOBILE_MONEY, PAYPAL)
   - Enter reference number
   - Click "Mark as Paid" → Status: PAID
   - Records payment timestamp

5. **Export Data**
   - Export summary CSV for accounting
   - Export line items CSV for detailed records

### Freelancer Workflow
1. View payment history with filters
2. Expand payment to see detailed breakdown
3. Review work completed and amounts
4. Check payment status and payment information

---

## Technical Highlights

### Payment Calculation Logic
```javascript
// Based on project payment model
if (project.paymentModel === 'HOURLY' && record.hoursWorked) {
  rate = project.hourlyRateAnnotation;
  amount = record.hoursWorked * rate;
} else if (project.paymentModel === 'PER_ASSET' && record.assetsCompleted) {
  rate = project.perAssetRateAnnotation;
  amount = record.assetsCompleted * rate;
} else if (project.paymentModel === 'PER_OBJECT' && record.tasksCompleted) {
  rate = project.perObjectRateAnnotation;
  amount = record.tasksCompleted * rate;
}
```

### Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Freelancers can only view their own payments
- Payment deletion prevented for PAID status
- Admin/Finance roles required for all management operations

### Data Integrity
- Unique constraint on `freelancerId`, `year`, `month`
- Prevents duplicate payment records for same period
- Cascade deletion of line items when payment is deleted
