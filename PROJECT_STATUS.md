## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1-7: Core Platform Features
**Status:** Complete
All core features implemented including authentication, applications, freelancer management, projects, performance tracking, tiering, payments, and communications.

See full details in sections below for each phase.

---

### ✅ Phase 8: Project Application Workflow (NEW)
**Status:** Complete (October 6, 2025)
**Features:**
- **Freelancer Application System**
  - Freelancers can apply to open projects
  - Applications tracked as PENDING assignments
  - Visual separation on dashboard:
    - Active Projects (Green cards - approved)
    - Pending Applications (Yellow cards - awaiting approval)
    - Rejected Applications (Red cards - with rejection reason)

- **PM Application Review**
  - Projects page shows Applications vs Assigned counts
  - Project detail page shows pending applications table
  - Approve/Reject buttons for each application
  - Optional rejection reason field
  - Notifications sent on approval/rejection

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Engaged Freelancers metric restored
  - Active Freelancers = available but not on projects
  - Engaged Freelancers = working on active projects

- **Color-Coded Status Cards**
  - Green background: Active/Approved projects
  - Yellow background: Pending applications
  - Red background: Rejected applications

**Key Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/controllers/projectController.js`
  - Added `getProjectApplications()` - Get PENDING assignments
  - Added `approveProjectApplication()` - Approve and change to ACTIVE
  - Added `rejectProjectApplication()` - Reject with reason
  - Fixed `getProjectById()` to not reference non-existent applications relation
  - Modified `getAllProjects()` to separate PENDING from ACTIVE counts

- `backend/src/routes/projectRoutes.js`
  - Added `GET /api/projects/:id/applications`
  - Added `POST /api/projects/:id/applications/:freelancerId/approve`
  - Added `POST /api/projects/:id/applications/:freelancerId/reject`

- `frontend/src/services/api.js`
  - Added `projectsAPI.getApplications()`
  - Added `projectsAPI.approveApplication()`
  - Added `projectsAPI.rejectApplication()`

- `frontend/src/pages/FreelancerDashboard.jsx`
  - Added green cards for active projects with ✅ icon
  - Added yellow cards for pending applications with ⏳ icon
  - Added red cards for rejected applications with ❌ icon
  - Shows rejection reason when applicable
  - Added section titles with counts

- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.jsx`
  - Added applications state and loadApplications()
  - Added Pending Applications section with table
  - Added Approve/Reject buttons
  - Filtered Assigned Freelancers to show ACTIVE only
  - Added handleApproveApplication() and handleRejectApplication()

- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectsPage.jsx`
  - Already had expandable table layout
  - Counts properly separated (Applications vs Assigned)

- `backend/src/controllers/dashboardController.js`
  - Fixed Active Freelancers calculation
  - Added proper Engaged Freelancers calculation
  - Removed onboardingStatus requirement

- `backend/src/controllers/freelancerPortalController.js`
  - Modified getDashboard() to separate assignments by status
  - Returns activeProjects, pendingApplications, rejectedApplications
  - Rejection reason stored in completionNotes field

**Workflow:**
1. Freelancer applies to project → Creates PENDING assignment
2. PM sees application count on Projects page
3. PM clicks View Details → Sees Pending Applications table
4. PM clicks Approve → Status changes to ACTIVE, notification sent
5. PM clicks Reject → Status changes to REJECTED with reason, notification sent
6. Freelancer sees color-coded cards:
   - Green = Working on project (ACTIVE)
   - Yellow = Waiting for approval (PENDING)
   - Red = Not approved (REJECTED)

**Database:**
- Uses existing ProjectAssignment model
- Status field: 'PENDING' | 'ACTIVE' | 'REJECTED'
- Rejection reason stored in completionNotes field

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Email Sending:** Configured but skipped in development mode
2. **File Upload:** No file upload for freelancer documents
3. **Search:** Basic text search, no full-text search
4. **Real-time:** No WebSocket support for live updates
5. **Mobile:** Not optimized for mobile devices
6. **Reapplication:** Freelancers can see rejected projects but current UI doesn't prevent reapplication (feature not yet requested)

### Temporary Workarounds
1. **Email Testing:** Use Prisma Studio to view Notification table
2. **Performance:** Small datasets only (SQLite limitation)
3. **Search:** Use browser Ctrl+F for now

### Priority 3: Production Preparation
1. Switch to PostgreSQL
2. Set up production environment variables
3. Enable email sending
