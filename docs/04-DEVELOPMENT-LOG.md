# Development Log

## Session 1 - 2025-09-30

### Pre-Development Phase

#### Requirements Gathering ✅
- Analyzed existing Excel spreadsheets (2 files)
- Reviewed detailed answers to business questions (answers.txt)
- Reviewed clarifications (clarification.txt)
- Documented complete requirements

**Key Insights**:
- 4000+ freelancers to manage
- Zero budget constraint
- Non-technical stakeholder
- GDPR compliance required
- Complex performance tracking system

#### Technical Planning ✅
- Selected technology stack:
  - Backend: Node.js + Express + Prisma + SQLite
  - Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
  - Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
- Designed documentation strategy
- Created project structure plan

### Current Status

**In Progress**:
- Creating comprehensive documentation

**Up Next**:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Set up project structure
3. Design database schema
4. Implement backend API
5. Create frontend application
6. Implement application form
7. Build admin panel

### Session Goals (Today)
- [x] Complete project setup
- [x] Database schema implemented
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] Freelancer application form functional
- [x] Admin approval workflow working
- [x] Basic freelancer list view

### Completed Features ✅
1. **Backend API (Node.js + Express + Prisma + SQLite)**
   - User authentication with JWT
   - Application submission endpoint (public)
   - Application approval/rejection (admin)
   - Freelancer listing with filters
   - Role-based access control
   - Comprehensive database schema (15+ tables)

2. **Frontend (React + Vite + React Router)**
   - Login page (admin/staff)
   - Application form (public, freelancers)
   - Admin dashboard with tabs
   - Applications management (view, approve, reject)
   - Freelancers list view

3. **Development Environment**
   - Git repository with clean commit history
   - Backend running on http://localhost:3000
   - Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
   - Documentation structure in place

### Blockers
None - MVP completed successfully!

### Decisions Made
1. **Monorepo structure**: Single repo for backend + frontend
2. **SQLite for development**: Easy setup, migrate to PostgreSQL later
3. **Documentation-first approach**: Ensure continuity between sessions
4. **JWT authentication**: Secure, stateless, industry standard
5. **Phase 1 focus**: Application form + Admin approval only

### Notes
- User has zero coding experience
- Need to make setup as simple as possible
- Code comments should be educational
- Focus on working software over perfect code
