# Development Log

## Session 1 - 2025-09-30

### Pre-Development Phase

#### Requirements Gathering ✅
- Analyzed existing Excel spreadsheets (2 files)
- Reviewed detailed answers to business questions (answers.txt)
- Reviewed clarifications (clarification.txt)
- Documented complete requirements

**Key Insights**:
- 4000+ freelancers to manage
- Zero budget constraint
- Non-technical stakeholder
- GDPR compliance required
- Complex performance tracking system

#### Technical Planning ✅
- Selected technology stack:
  - Backend: Node.js + Express + Prisma + SQLite
  - Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
  - Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
- Designed documentation strategy
- Created project structure plan

### Current Status

**In Progress**:
- Creating comprehensive documentation

**Up Next**:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Set up project structure
3. Design database schema
4. Implement backend API
5. Create frontend application
6. Implement application form
7. Build admin panel

### Session Goals (Today)
- [ ] Complete project setup
- [ ] Database schema implemented
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Freelancer application form functional
- [ ] Admin approval workflow working
- [ ] Basic freelancer list view

### Blockers
None currently

### Decisions Made
1. **Monorepo structure**: Single repo for backend + frontend
2. **SQLite for development**: Easy setup, migrate to PostgreSQL later
3. **Documentation-first approach**: Ensure continuity between sessions
4. **JWT authentication**: Secure, stateless, industry standard
5. **Phase 1 focus**: Application form + Admin approval only

### Notes
- User has zero coding experience
- Need to make setup as simple as possible
- Code comments should be educational
- Focus on working software over perfect code
