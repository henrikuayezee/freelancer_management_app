A. Onboarding & Training

  1. Training modules: Are these video courses, documents, or hands-on tasks in CVAT? Should they be hosted in the platform or just tracked? - there are videos and documents hosted on google drive and the actual training is done on CVAT.
  2. Fitment tests: Are these similar to onboarding tests (task-based in annotation tools)? Who reviews and grades them? -  They are not similar, this are more project specific and the training leads and QAs review these tasks

  B. Performance Metrics

  3. COM scores (5 soft skill categories): Who provides these ratings and when (after each project? monthly reviews)? - This depends, either per project of a project is excueted within the same month or monthly when the project goes beyond a month
  4. QUAL scores: Which metrics auto-calculate from annotation platform APIs vs. manual entry? - Currently, there are done manually
  5. Tier progression: What are the exact thresholds? (e.g., "90%+ accuracy + 100 hours = Silver tier") - can we work on this later

  C. Project Assignment Logic

  6. When freelancers "apply" to jobs on the job board, do they just express interest, or do they provide additional info (hours available, rate expectations)? - When they apply for the job, we want to know their availability, but we do not collect more info.
  7. Auto-unavailable feature: When a freelancer is assigned to a project, should they be completely hidden from other projects, or just marked as "engaged"? Which feature will make sense, I think we should see them but they should be marked as engaged. and they should not be able to apply for any other jobs

  D. Technical Details

  8. Authentication: Should freelancers create accounts themselves, or are accounts created for them after application approval? - They should be created only after their approval
  9. Slack integration: Should the platform automatically invite freelancers to Slack, or just generate an invite link? - automatically invite freelancers to the platform
  10. CVAT accounts: Same question - auto-create or manual? - this has to be done manually by the freelancers

  E. Data Migration

  11. The current spreadsheet has 9 freelancers (test data?) but you mentioned 4000+ total - do you have a complete database we need to migrate? - Yes we have a complete database we will need to migrate
  12. Historical performance data - how far back should we import (1 year, 2 years, all-time)? - For now we will not want to import but move forward but we need to have a feature so if we have to import it will be easier and it will be less than a year
